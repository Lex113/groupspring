Hey!
So we can just dump our text here. and theres a folder for pics as well.
this will make it easier for whoever does the content for the website.
I switched to barbados. and uploaded some pictures. i will rename later.
The way i thought of it was food, culture, and fun facts. so the idea was to 
grab some texts and pictures and we can make it pretty! see you guys in class.


Fariza- Barbados

modal 1- give way

Driving in Barbados is easy. People are always willing to help. Try the Barbadian bus for $2 or “reggae bus” for $1. All easy and safe!

modal 2- money

The currency is 1:2 for USD to the Barbadian dollar. Locals are willing to accept British pounds and American Dollar.

modal 3 - bar

Lots of shack makeshift bars in Barbados. Friendly locals, and great prices!

modal 4- colorful

Try staying in a homestay, small hotels, or any other local accommodations. Its a great way to really appreciate the food, hospitality, and culture of this amazing country.
